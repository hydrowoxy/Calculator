# Assorted Calculators

An ongoing personal project to create some calculators (and other tools) for various math and computer science / software engineering courses.

## Currently Functional
### Really Basic LaTeX Editor
- I mostly wanted to learn how to use MathJax so that's how this came to be
- Ended up using better-react-mathjax

### Binary Addition Calculator
- You can change the number of bits you're adding
- There's a matrix of buttons you can click to toggle between 0 and 1
- The result shows up under the two numbers and updates as you click to change bits
- The base-2 precedence of each bit is shown above each column of the addition

## Future Calculator Ideas
- Integrals using Maxima
- Derivatives using Maxima
- Leibniz Inference Rule
- K-maps
- 2's complement and binary subtraction
- Textual substitutions into propositional and predicate expressions
- Determine if a variable is free or bound in a quantification
